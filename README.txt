To run the code create a new text file with the .txt extension. 
Then run the code and then type the name of the file into the terminal.
Then type the name of the .bin file after you have entered the .txt file name.
The code will encode and decode the file in one pass.
The files in the folder will be filename.txt filename.bin filename.bin_huffman_tree.txt.
filename.txt is the original file filename.bin is the binary encoded file and filename.bin_huffman_tree.txt is the Huffman tree.

Books that I encoded : http://www.gutenberg.org/files/46/46-0.txt (A Christmas Carol)
